# nmc-numpyro

[JAX](https://opensource.google/projects/jax)/[NumPyro](http://num.pyro.ai/)-based unofficial implementation of the *Newtonian Monte-Carlo* MCMC sampling algorithm, as proposed in [*Newtonian Monte Carlo: single-site MCMC meets second-order gradient methods (Arora et al., 2020)*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05567.pdf).  

This repository originally started as a *best-effort- maintained, repackaged, and eventually improved fork of [@Johanpdrsn's repository](https://github.com/Johanpdrsn/Newtonian-Monte-Carlo)*.
